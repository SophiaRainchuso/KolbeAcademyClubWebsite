          <p>Meetings: The plan is to meet every 2 or 3 weeks, and have lively, thoughtful, truthful and inspiring
            conversations on important matters in philosophy, theology, and apologetics – something desperately
            needed today!
            • Discussions All-Year: We will have an ongoing Discussion Board to carry on these important topics as
            well. The topics of discussion ideally will be student driven – that is, I would like students to suggest
            topics to discuss.
            • Leadership Positions Available: If you like, we can even have a President and Vice President, too!
            Please have your student email Dr. Hasler to let him know if he or she would like to run for one of these
            positions. A short description of why the student would make a great President/Vice President and any
            ideas for this club should be included by the student. We will be voting for officers at our first meeting.
            Of course, this is not necessary either to have good discussions!!</p>
